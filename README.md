This is a compilation of the assignments I completed for NJIT's CS388 course (Android Development) during the Fall Semester of 2023. At the beginning of the semester I had 0 mobile development experience, and only limited knowledge of Java/Kotlin. 
By the end of the semester, I was able to work in a team with 3 of my classmates to develop "MindQuest". an social mobile game for Android where users test their reaction speeds and memory skills and see how they rank on a global leaderboard. (link)
